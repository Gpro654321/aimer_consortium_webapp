To bring down the mental clutter before sending certificates to a workshop

    1. I should be able to select participants and send certificates from certificate_status admin panel
        itself (priority 3)
    2. The font color for the participant's name should automatically be chosen such that it is visible
        A automatic visiblity checker should be implemented. (priority 2)
    3. Before sending certificates to a workshop group, there should be a sample certificate shown to me
        with the list of participants who have attended this workshop. (priority 1)
